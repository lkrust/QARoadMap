### 2. What are some advantages of unit testing?:

<Details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
<br>- Unit testing increases confidence in changing / maintaining code
<br>- Codes are more reusable.
<br>- The cost of fixing a defect detected during unit testing is lesser in comparison to that of defects detected at higher levels.
<br>- Debugging is easy. When a test fails, only the latest changes need to be debugged.
</Details>

### 2. What are some disadvantages of unit testing?:

<Details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
<br>- It's difficult to write quality unit tests and the whole process can be time-consuming.
<br>- Not all errors can be detected, since every module it tested separately and later different integration bugs may appear.
