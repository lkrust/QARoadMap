## Exercises:

### 1. What are the expected benefits of acceptance tests?

<Details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	Acceptance testing has the following benefits, complementing those which can be obtained from unit tests:

	- encouraging closer collaboration between developers on the one hand and customers, users or domain experts on the other, as they entail that business requirements should be expressed
	- providing a clear and unambiguous “contract” between customers and developers; a product which passes acceptance tests will be considered adequate (though customers and developers might refine existing tests or suggest new ones as necessary)
	- decreasing the chance and severity both of new defects and regressions (defects impairing functionality previously reviewed and declared acceptable)
