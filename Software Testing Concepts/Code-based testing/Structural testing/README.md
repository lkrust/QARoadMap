## Exercises:

### 1.  What do you understand by the term ‘Functional testing’?

<Details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	A black box testing technique, where the functionality of an application is tested to generate the desired output by providing certain input is called ‘Functional testing’.
	The role of functional testing is not only to validate the behavior of the application as per the requirement document specification but is also to verify whether the application is ready to be released into the live environment or not.
	Given below are a few functional testing techniques that are commonly used:

	- Unit testing
	- Smoke testing
	- Integration testing
	- System testing
	- Usability testing
	- Regression testing
	- User Acceptance testing
</Details>

### 2. What are the important steps that are covered in Functional testing?

<Details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	Following are the steps that should be covered as a part of functional testing:
	Understanding the Requirement document specification and clearing the doubts and queries in the form of review comments.
	Writing the test cases with respect to the requirement specification by keeping in mind all the scenarios that should be considered for all the cases.
	Identifying the test inputs and requesting the test data that is required to execute the test cases as well as to check the functionality of the application.
	Determine the actual outcomes as per the input values to be tested.
	Execute the test cases that determine whether application behavior is as expected or any defect has occurred.
	Compare the actual result and the computed result to find out the actual outcome.
