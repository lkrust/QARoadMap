## Exercises:

### 1. Define heuristics?

<Details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	Psychology: "Principles which reduce the complex tasks of assessing probabilities and predicting values to simpler judgmental operations."
  In simpler words, heuristics are cognitive shortcuts. We use them under conditions of uncertainty, often automatically without knowing using system 1 thinking, to rapidly solve problems and make decisions. When you consider the vast number of decisions people make on a daily basis, it makes a lot of sense for our brains to use shortcuts to help us quickly assess the different options available.

### 2. Why are heuristics useful for testing?

<Details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
  It provide shortcuts, hints for our test sessions. It's a good way to structure a test plan when you don't have much information to begin with.

### 3. List 5 heuristics and explain them.

<Details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	Well, this is on you. I am sorry. Google it! There are so many examples and it's good to write them down after reading it.

### 4. Create your own Heuristic.

<Details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	Obviously, this is also on you. Feel free to search examples, but here are some tips to create your own:
  - Think on a test scenario. 
    - How would you test it?
    - What tools would you use?
    - Should it be autoamted? How?
  - Now take your last answers and go for a next scenario
    - What are you repeating?
    - What you missed?
  You use heuristics unconsciously, rationalize it and you will be more efficient.
