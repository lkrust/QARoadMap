## Exercises:

### 1. What is Exploratory Testing?

<Details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	Exploratory testing is a hands-on approach in which testers are involved in minimum planning and maximum test execution. The planning involves the creation of a test charter, a short declaration of the scope of a short (1 to 2 hour) time-boxed test effort, the objectives and possible approaches to be used. The test design and test execution activities are performed in parallel typically without formally documenting the test conditions, test cases or test scripts. This does not mean that other, more formal testing techniques will not be used. For example, the tester may decide to use boundary value analysis but will think through and test the most important boundary values without necessarily writing them down. Some notes will be written during the exploratory-testing session so that a report can be produced afterward.

### 2. Why do we do exploratory testing?

<Details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	- It helps the tester quickly identify major discrepancies, thus helping to develop the application to meet actual-world requirements of end users.
	- It’s cognitively structured compared to the procedural framework of scripted testing.
	-  It’s an approach and not a technique. The next course of actions is governed by the current course of actions.
	- It’s significantly teachable and manageable.
	- Exploratory testing itself is highly useful but when dovetailed with other testing processes, it becomes a powerful way to understand the application in a better manner, build better functional tests and finally enhance the quality of the application.

### 3. Can exploratory testing be automated?

<Details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	Exploratory testing cannot be automated as it involves learning about the software to test and test case development on the learning. Automation can help in specific part of exploratory testing like documentation or intermediate processing of data if needed for test case development, can be automated.

### 4. What is Exploratory Testing in Agile?

<Details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	Exploratory Testing in Agile is aligned to Agile principle, of interactions over processes and tools. Exploratory Testing involves concurrent learning of the system under test, execution and design of test cases. Exploratory Testing makes the tester in the focus.
