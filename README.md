# QARoadMap

The idea of this repo is to help fellow QAs/testers to learn and grow. 
I got the idea of gathering material from this [QA Roadmap](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kkqqHXk=/) and from another studying list [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)
Feel free to add more information!


## How to use it

<summary>How to use it</summary>

I'm using Github's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to check progress.


**Create a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the brackets: [x]**

<details>
    
    Fork a branch and follow the commands below

`git checkout -b progress`

`git remote add jwasham https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university`

`git fetch --all`

    Mark all boxes with X after you completed your changes

`git add .`

`git commit -m "Marked x"`

`git rebase jwasham/master`

`git push --force`
